# Beeper

Welcome to our GitHub page!

Beeper is a universal messaging app that lets you chat seamlessly across more than 10 chat networks, including WhatsApp, Telegram, and more. Want to use Beeper? Download it from [beeper.com](https://beeper.com) or check out our [FAQ](https://beeper.com/faq).

## Open Source

Beeper is built on top of [Matrix](https://matrix.org), an open-source chat protocol. When we started building Beeper, we made the fundamental decision to open-source most of our backend code and provide you with the option to self-host. We chose this approach because:

- We want you to be able to inspect the source code Beeper uses to connect to other chat networks.
- We want to contribute to the Matrix ecosystem.
- We want to provide robust libraries for others to develop open-source Matrix bridges.
