# Beeper 

Welcome to our Github page! 

Beeper is a universal messaging app that lets you chat with anyone on any chat app, including Whatsapp, iMessage, Telegram and 12 other networks. Want to use Beeper? Download it from [beeper.com](https://beeper.com) or read the [FAQ](https://beeper.com/faq).

## Open source
Beeper is built on top of an open source chat protocol called [Matrix](https://matrix.org). When we started building Beeper, we made a fundamental decision to open source the majority of our backend code and provide you with the option to self-host Beeper. We chose to do this because:
- We want you to be able to inspect the source code that Beeper uses to connect to other chat networks
- We want to contribute to the Matrix ecosystem
- We want to provide great libraries for others to develop open source Matrix bridges
